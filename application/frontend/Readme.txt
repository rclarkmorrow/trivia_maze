Our project includes the following feature that can be considered as extra credits:

1. Create a preset path from the entrance to the exit, which is the room intersected with the dungeon perimeter during dungeon creation, so that each dungeon generated is valid and traversable. 4 pillars are dropped along the path.

2. While setting up the path, the program mandatorily preset the minimum steps from entrance to exit using a variable so that it allows different hard level.

3. Use RoomFactory class and categorize room types as typical rooms, rooms along the traversable path, and entrance/exit.

4. Unit testing of all classes. A capture of output is attached.

5. Two GUI approaches using Tkinter that displays the whole dungeon and the location of the adventurer, which also allows the player to use keyboard key "Up", "Down", "Left" and "Right" to control the movement of the adventurer. The scorecard will be updated accordingly as the adventurer moves within the dungeon. Two screen recordings are attached. One shows the whole dungeon with room content, such as pillars and vision potions, and doors connecting between the rooms. One hides all the room contents and doors.
